<!--<span class="markdown">-->
<p>
The two most central concepts are the <a href="#User">users</a> and <a href="#Request">requests</a>. A user can request help and help fellow users. The property <a href="#isOriginatorOf">isOriginatorOf</a> is used to link a request to a user asking for help. The property <a href="#accepts">accepts</a> is used to link a helper to a request. A user can have <a href="#Skill">skills</a> and <a href="#Limitation">limitations</a>, which are linked to the user with the properties <a href="#hasSkill">hasSkill</a> and <a href="#hasLimitation">hasLimitation</a>. A request can also have skills and limitations associated to it, using the properties <a href="#requiresSkill">requiresSkill</a> and <a href="#excludesByLimitation">excludesByLimitation</a>. A request also has an <a href="#Environment">environment</a>, which can be expressed with the property <a href="#hasEnvironment">hasEnvironment</a>.
</p>

<p>
To keep track of the time-balance of a user, each request is worth a specific amount of time. The property <a href="#hasAccreditedDuration">hasAccreditedDuration</a> is used to express this amount of time. The current time-balance of a user is calculated by adding all time durations for which the user was a helper (<a href="#accepts">acceppted</a> a request) and subtract all time durations for which the user was a receiver of help (<a href="#isOriginatorOf">originator</a> of a request). The initial time-balance can be expressed by the property <a href="#hasTimeBalance">hasTimeBalance</a>.

The following figure illustrates the basic concept of the Timebank ontology.

<p>
In the following, we proivide some examples on how to use our timebank ontology.
</p>

<p>
First, we will create a new user, Alice. We will reuse the <a href="http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/">FOAF</a> vocabulary the indicate the name of the user. The user's address is expressed using the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2006/vcard/ns">VCard</a> ontology.
</p>

<pre>
<code class="language-RDF/Turtle">
ex:Alice a tb:User ;
    foaf:familyName "Owl" ;
    foaf:firstName "Alice" ;
    tb:hasAddress ex:VCardA .
ex:VCardA a v:VCard .
</code>
</pre>

<p>
Next, we link the skill <a href="#ComputerRepair">tb:ComputerRepair</a> with Alice and the limitation <a href="#PoorHearing">tb:PoorHearing</a>.
</p>

<pre>
<code class="language-RDF/Turtle">
ex:Alice tb:hasSkill [a tb:ComputerRepair ;
    tb:hasSkillLevel tb:LevelHigh ;
    rdfs:comment "30 years experience with computers." ] .
ex:Alice tb:hasLimitation [a tb:PoorHearing ;
    tb:hasSeverity tb:LevelLow ;
    rdfs:comment "Preferrably, speak into my left ear." ] .
</code>
</pre>

<p>
Alice is available every Saturday and Sunday from 1pm until 6pm, starting from 2019-03-30. We use the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2006/time">Time</a> vocabulary to express this.
</p>

<pre>
<code class="language-RDF/Turtle">
ex:Alice tb:isAvailableOn [
    a time:ProperInterval ;
    time:hasBeginning [time:inXSDDateTimeStamp
        "2019-03-30T13:00:00+08:00"^^xsd:dateTimeStamp ] ;
    time:hasEnd [time:inXSDDateTimeStamp
        "2019-03-30T18:00:00+08:00"^^xsd:dateTimeStamp ] ;
    tb:repeatsOn time:Saturday ;
    tb:repeatsOn time:Sunday ] .
</code>
</pre>

Bob wants to create a new  <a href="#Request">request</a> to ask for help to <a href="#ComputerRepair">fix his computer</a>. As Bob owns a dog, he <a href="#excludesUserByLimitation">excludes users</a> who have a fear of dogs from the request. Since Alice is available, qualified to help, and not afraid of dogs, she <a href="#isAcceptedBy">accepts</a> the request.

<pre>
<code class="language-RDF/Turtle">
ex:Request a tb:Request ;
    rdfs:comment "My email client fails to synchronize." ;
    tb:requiresSkill tb:ComputerRepair ;
    tb:excludesUserByLimitation tb:FearOfDogs ;
    tb:hasOriginator ex:Bob ;
    tb:isAcceptedBy ex:Alice ] .
