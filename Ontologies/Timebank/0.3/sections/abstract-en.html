<h2>Abstract</h2><span class="markdown">
The Timebank Ontology is used to describe Timebank systems for Peer-to-Peer Service Exchange. A Timebank allows user to store virtual money, often called a Time Dollar, into a bank account [Cahn2004]. This virtual currency can be earned by helping fellow Timebank users and spent by requesting help from others. The main goal of the ontology is to facilitate the matching between helpers and requesters of help. This can be achieved by describing the context of users and their request using our vocabulary. To describe the context of a user and its request, the ontology provides classes for skills, limitations, and the environment. Skills define what a person can do. For example, a person might be able to perform certain repairs or can help cooking. Limitations define what a person cannot do. This includes health related problems, disabilities, and phobias. Finally, the environment describes the available supplies and the accessibility of a request.</span>
