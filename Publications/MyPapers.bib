  abstract = {Federated querying, the idea to execute queries over several distributed knowledge bases, lies at the core of the semantic web vision. To accommodate this vision, SPARQL provides the SERVICE keyword that allows one to allocate sub-queries to servers. In many cases, however, data may be available from multiple sources resulting in a combinatorially growing number of alternative allocations of subqueries to sources. Running a federated query on all possible sources might not be very lucrative from a user's point of view if extensive execution times or fees are involved in accessing the sources' data. To address this shortcoming, federated join-cardinality approximation techniques have been proposed to narrow down the number of possible allocations to a few most promising (or results-yielding) ones. In this paper, we analyze the usefulness of cardinality approximation for source selection. We compare both the runtime and accuracy of Bloom Filters empirically and elaborate on their suitability and limitations for different kind of queries. As we show, the performance of cardinality approximations of federated SPARQL queries degenerates when applied to queries with multiple joins of low selectivity. We generalize our results analytically to any estimation technique exhibiting false positives. These findings argue for a renewed effort to find novel join-cardinality approximation techniques or a change of paradigm in query execution to settings, where such estimations play a less important role.},

  abstract = {Stream Processing (SP) is an important Big Data technology enabling continuous querying of data streams. The stream setting offers the opportunity to exploit synergies and, theoretically, share the access and processing costs between multiple different collaborators. But what should be the monetary contribution of each consumer when they do not trust each other and have varying valuations of the differing outcomes? In this article, we present Collaborative Stream Processing (CSP), a model where the costs, which are set exogenously by providers, are shared between multiple consumers, the collaborators. For this, we identify three important requirements for CSP to establish trust between the collaborators and propose a CSP algorithm, ENCSPA, adhering to these requirements. Based on the collaborators' outcome valuations and the costs of the raw data streams, ENCSPA computes the payment for each collaborator. At the same time, ENCSPA ensures that no collaborator has an incentive to manipulate the system by providing misinformation about her/his value, budget, or time limit. We show that ENCSPA can calculate payments in a reasonable amount of time for up to one thousand collaborators.},

  abstract = {Fueled by enthusiasm of volunteers, government subsidies, and open data legislation, the Web of Data (WoD) has enjoyed a phenomenal growth. Commercial data, however, has been stuck in proprietary silos, as the monetization strategy for sharing data in the WoD is unclear. This is in contrast to the traditional web where advertisement fueled a lot of the growth. This raises the question how the WoD can (i) maintain its success when government subsidies disappear and (ii) convince commercial entities to share their wealth of data.},

  abstract = {Incident detection (ID), or the automatic discovery of anomalies from road traffic data (e.g., road sensor and GPS data), enables emergency actions (e.g., rescuing injured people) to be carried out in a timely fashion. Existing ID solutions based on data mining or machine learning often rely on dense traffic data; for instance, sensors installed in highways provide frequent updates of road information. In this paper, we ask the question: Can ID be performed on sparse traffic data (e.g., location data obtained from GPS devices equipped on vehicles)? As these data may not be enough to describe the state of the roads involved, they can undermine the effectiveness of existing ID solutions. To tackle this challenge, we borrow an important insight from the transportation area, which uses trajectories (i.e., moving histories of vehicles) to derive incident patterns. We study how to obtain incident patterns from trajectories and devise a new solution (called Filter-Discovery-Match (FDM)) to detect anomalies in sparse traffic data. Experiments on a taxi dataset in Hong Kong and a simulated dataset show that FDM is more effective than state-of-the-art ID solutions on sparse traffic data.},
