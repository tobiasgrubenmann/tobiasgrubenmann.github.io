<h2>Abstract</h2><span class="markdown">
The Timebank Ontology is used to describe Timebank systems for Peer-to-Peer Service Exchange. The main goal of the ontology is to factilitate the matching between helpers and requesters of help. This can be achieved by describing the context of users and their request using our vocabulary. This ontology includes a rich class hierarchy to describe a user's skills, limitations, and the environment.</span>
